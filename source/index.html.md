# Introduction

Welcome to the Pocketwatch API! You can use our API to access Pocketwatch API endpoints, which can get information on various cats, timers, and breeds in our database.

We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, and Python! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

This example API documentation page was created with [Slate](https://github.com/lord/slate). Feel free to edit it and use it as a base for your own API's documentation.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```javascript
const pocketwatch = require('@dosy/pocketwatch');

let api = pocketwatch.authorize('<your API key>');
```

> Make sure to replace `<your API key>` with your API key.

Pocketwatch uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Pocketwatch API key at our [developer portal](https://api.pocketwatch.xyz/).

Pocketwatch expects your `apiKey` be included in all API requests to the server in as a parameter of the POST body in `application/json` (shown, but `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` is okay, too) like the following:

```javascript
{
  apiKey: "<your API key>"
  ... request ...
}
```

<aside class="notice">
  You must replace <code>&lt;your API key&gt;</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>

# Timers

## Create a new Timer

```javascript
const pocketwatch = require('@dosy/pocketwatch');

let api = pocketwatch.authorize('<your API key>');
let timers = api.timer.create({
  name: "My new timer",
  interval: "second",
  interval_count: 1,
  duration: "week",
  duration_count: 2
});
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```javascript
{
  "action": "create",
  "status": "success",
  "timer": {
    "keyName": "<timer keyName>"
  }
}
```

This endpoint creates a new timer.
